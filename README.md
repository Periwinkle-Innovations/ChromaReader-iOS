ChromaReader-iOS
================

The goal of this porject is to create an easy-to-use app for both experienced, involved veterans of the Chroma wars and fresh, new recruits. It aims to provide an interactive and up-to-date map of Chroma, to use push notifications to alert users of upcoming battles, to chronicle Chroma lore, and to provide easy-to-use mobile access to public chat.

This project is still currently in the planing phase, and any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
